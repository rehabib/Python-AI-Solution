## Overview

This assignment consists of multiple Python functions designed to:  
- Classify medical imaging scans  
- Assess patient risk levels  
- Determine scan settings based on various parameters  

Each function presents a coding exercise where a specific condition needs to be implemented. 

## Testing

Each function includes assertions using `pytest` to verify correctness.  
To run the tests, execute the script and ensure all assertions pass.
